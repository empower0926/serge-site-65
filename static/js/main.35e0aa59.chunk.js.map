Maurice Lobreau is recognized in\n              the world of finance and more particularly in the world of\n              Distributed ledger technology . With the launch of his financial\n              solution in 2017, he marked a real turning point in his career by\n              embarking on his own entrepreneurial adventure. But before he\n              could get to this stage, the young man had to face many\n              difficulties. It is a perfect illustration of a self-made man full\n              of ambition. A look back at his life and his significant\n              experiences.{\" \"}\n            </p>\n            <h3 className=\"heading\">A difficult childhood in Congo</h3>\n            <p>\n              Serge Maurice Lobreau's life began in the Democratic Republic of\n              Congo. He was born in the late 1970s in Mbuji-Mayi. It is a city\n              located in Katanga province, generally known for its mining\n              resources. He is a member of a big family and shares his life with\n              his brothers and sisters. Unfortunately, at the age of barely ten,\n              Serge Maurice Lobreau lost his grandfather. At his funeral, he met\n              for the first time his aunt who lived in France. She took Serge\n              and his brothers and sisters under her wing and brought them to\n              France to give them a chance to succeed. However, administrative\n              procedures prevent them from being able to reach their aunt\n              quickly. The siblings then spent more than a year in the DRC\n              capital, Kinshasa.Unfortunately, this year in Kinshasa is marked\n              by the violence and abuses that Serge Maurice Lobreau has to face\n              every day of his year in Kinshasa. Finally, it was in 1989 that\n              the Congolese administration authorized the departure for France.\n              A new beginning is then possible for the young man.\n            </p>\n            <h3 className=\"heading\">A new life in France</h3>\n            <p>\n              Serge Maurice Lobreau arrived on French territory at the beginning\n              of his teenage years. But in just a few months, the teenager\n              quickly became familiar with the French language and gradually\n              acclimatized to life in France. Together with his siblings, he\n              grew up in a suburb where delinquency is very prevalent. To avoid\n              rushing down this path, the young man devotes his time to his\n              studies and undertakes to work on his free time. He continued on\n              to high school, before graduating from high school and pursuing\n              university studies. He entered law school, while working in\n              parallel to support himself. Through these different student jobs,\n              Serge Lobreau meets influential people, who encourage him to\n              engage in entrepreneurship. He first started out in events, before\n              resuming his studies in finance until he obtained a master's\n              degree in Finance that enabled him to find a job abroad.\n            </p>\n            <h3 className=\"heading\">The way to entrepreneurship and success</h3>\n            <p>\n              After having acquired solid experience in the world of finance,\n              Serge Maurice Lobreau decided to return to his first passion:\n              entrepreneurship. Thus, in 2014, he founded Sapian Group. He then\n              proposed a financial solution called Flashmoni. In five years, the\n              young entrepreneur has developed his project and become an\n              influential player in finance and blockchain.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n
