              The risk of customers or geographic areas or jurisdictions is due

            <span>
              The risk arising from the communication channel with customers is
              due to the fact that communication with the customer takes place

            <span>
              through communication channels and FlashXchanger OZTG OÜ may not

            <h3 class="heading">
              Risk levels depending on the communication channel
            </h3>
            <span>
              - if the communication takes place personally, at FlashXchanger
              OZTG OÜ office and the customer is identified by the employee,
              then the risk is
            </span>
            <span>minimal.</span>
            <span>
              - the employee must make sure that the customer understands the
              transaction that he wants to make and that the customer will be
              able
            </span>
            <span>to carry out promises made in the future.</span>
            <span>
              - if the communication takes place through information technology
              channels, the employee must be attentive, since the communication
            </span>
            <span>
              with the customer via IT tools allows the customer to conceal his
              or her real desires.
            </span>
            <span>
              - in case the customer interacts with the employee through IT
              tools both orally and in writing, when answers to the questions
              submitted
            </span>
            <span>
              are given in a reasonable time, and the customer knows the nature
              of the activity being represented, and the customer knows the data
            </span>
            <span>
              about his / her business (eg, actual beneficiaries, owners,
              location, contact details, etc.) and the customer is able to
              describe its potential
            </span>
            <span>
              partners and / or areas of activity, the given risk is assessed as
              average.
            </span>
            <span>
              - in case the customer communicates with the employee only in
              writing and the answers are delayed over a reasonable period of
              time, and
            </span>

              there are reasons to believe that this is fraud and / or money
