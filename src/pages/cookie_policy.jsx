              by a web page server, which is basically the computer that
              operates a web site. The

            <h3 className="heading">How long does a cookie stay on your device?</h3>
            <span>
              The length of time a cookie will stay on your computer depends on
              whether such cookie is a session or permanent cookie.
            </span>
            <h3 className="heading">Session cookie</h3>
            <span>
              Session cookie is usually stored as a session ID during the
              user&rsquo;s browsing session and is not personally identifiable.
              Session cookies are
            </span>
            <span>
              never written on the hard drive. When user completes the session
              and closes the browser, these cookies are automatically deleted
              from the
            </span>
            <span>
              user&rsquo;s computer. Session cookies expire at the end of the
              user&#39;s browser session and can also become no longer
              accessible after the
            </span>
            <span>
              session has been inactive for a specified length of time, usually
              20 minutes.
            </span>
            <h3 className="heading">Permanent cookie</h3>
            <span>
              Unlike session cookie, permanent cookie is stored on the
              user&rsquo;s computer even after the user&rsquo;s browser is
              closed. Permanent cookies allow
            </span>
            <span>
              to remember user&rsquo;s preferences to be used in the future
              browsing sessions.
            </span>
            <span>
              By its nature permanent cookie can be used to identify individual
              users and analyse user&rsquo;s surfing behavior on the Website.
              They are usually
            </span>
            <span>
              stored for a prolonged period of time, in some cases many years
              into the future.
