            </span>
            <span>with you, monitor and prevent any problems).</span>

              where we
            </span>

            <h3 class="heading">Security of Personal Data</h3>
            <span>
              We use certain technologies to ensure the confidentiality of your
              personal data. FlashXchanger OZTG OÜ uses several security
              measures, including,
            </span>
            <span>
              without limitation, SSL method, two-faction authentication, PCI
              scanning and internal data access restrictions to protect your
              personal data.
            </span>
            <span>
              However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
              electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
              commercially
            </span>
            <span>
              acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot
              guarantee absolute security of your personal data.
            </span>
            <h3 class="heading">Data Retention</h3>
            <span>
              We process information both inside and outside of the European
              Union and European Economic Area and rely on legally-provided
            </span>
            <span>
              mechanisms to lawfully transfer information across borders.
              Countries where we process information may have laws which are
              different, and
            </span>
            <span>
              potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country.
            </span>
            <span>
              We retain your personal data for as long as your account is in
              existence or necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collect
              it or as
            </span>
            <span>
              needed to provide you with the services, except if required
              otherwise by law. However, when your account is terminated for any
              reason, we
            </span>
            <span>will delete your personal information entirely.</span>
            <span>
              In some cases we may determine the period of data retention based
              on the period we need to access the data for the provision of
              services,
            </span>
            <span>
              receiving payment, resolving your customer support issues or for
              any other auditing or legal purposes.
            </span>
            <span>
              Retention periods may be changed from time to time based on
              regulatory requirements.
